# Welcome to documentation for rp-scrabble!
Feel free to go through the docs to get to know about how this project works!

This is a command-line Scrabble game written in C++ to explore object oriented programming.

**Find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/CodePurble/rp-scrabble)**

# NOTICE for users of v1.0
* Users of `v1.0` **MUST** re-install the application as the update to `v1.1` or higher contains breaking changes
* All future updates will conform to these changes

## Build requirements
* `cmake`
* `git`
* `make`
* `g++`

* To install them, run-

    * For Arch and Arch-based distributions (Manjaro, Artix, etc)

        `$ sudo pacman -S cmake git gcc make`

    * For Debian and Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, Pop_OS, etc)

        `$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install cmake git make g++`

## Build instructions
* Clone this repo

    `$ git clone https://github.com/CodePurble/rp-scrabble.git`

* Move into project directory

    `$ cd rp-scrabble`

* Build

    Run the install script with the appropriate argument-

    `$ ./install.sh arch # for Arch based distributions (Manjaro, Artix, etc)`

    `$ ./install.sh debian # for Debian based distributions (Ubuntu, Pop_OS, etc)`

    `$ ./install.sh custom # for other distributions`

* Now, simply running `rp-scrabble` should launch the game.
* If it doesn't launch, check the output of `$ echo $PATH`. If it does not contain `your-home-dir/.local/bin`, add it to your `PATH` like this-

    `$ echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" >> $HOME/.bashrc`

    `$ source $HOME/.bashrc`

## Other notes
* Keep the repo up to date by running `git pull` every once in a while in the project directory. Remember to rerun the install script after pulling to bring any changes into effect.
* Log files are stored in

    `$HOME/.local/share/rp-scrabble/logs`

* To uninstall, run the install script with the `uninstall` argument in the project directory

    `$ ./install.sh uninstall`

    **NOTE** This will also remove any log files created

* If you find any problems, please open up an issue
